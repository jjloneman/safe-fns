 * Matches one TSDoc line whose `@param` names a key of an object param.
 *
 * - The dot is the whole rule. A non-dotted `@param value - …` documents a
 *   positional param and is correct, so matching `@param` broadly would flag
 *   every one of those instead.
 *
 * - Group 1 is the line's `* ` prefix, which the report's column arithmetic
 *   needs; group 2 is the object's own name (`options`, `params`), so the
 *   message can quote the site as written.
 *
 * - The asterisk is optional because a doc block can be written without one
 *   per line, and Prettier reformats no comment's interior — so requiring it
 *   would leave that style permanently unscanned.
 *
 * - A JSDoc-style `{type}` and an optional-param `[` may sit between the tag
 *   and the name, so a comment carried over from plain JavaScript is caught
 *   too.

 * Reports a TSDoc `@param` whose name is dotted, e.g. `@param options.fallback`.

 * - `no-restricted-syntax` cannot express this: its selectors match AST nodes,
 *   and a doc block is a comment attached to the source text rather than a
 *   node the selector language can reach.
 *
 * - A pure comment scan, so it needs no type information.
 *
 * - Deliberately not fixable. Relocating the text means finding the matching
 *   property in the type literal, deleting rather than moving it when the param
 *   type is imported, and re-wrapping prose to the print width — three
 *   judgment calls a fixer would get wrong silently.
