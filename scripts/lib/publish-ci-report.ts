/**
 * Shared CI-report publishing: GitHub Actions job summary + a sticky PR
 * comment, upserted by a marker string.
 *
 * - Used by the coverage and CI timings report scripts so each keeps its own
 *   sticky comment. `gh pr comment --edit-last` can't do that — it edits the
 *   bot's most recent comment regardless of content, so two reports posting
 *   that way would clobber each other on alternate runs. Instead the comment
 *   is located by its marker (the report's opening `## …` heading) via the
 *   GitHub API and PATCHed in place, or created when absent.
 *
 * - Best-effort + report-only: outside GitHub Actions it just prints the
 *   caller's `localConsole` (nothing if omitted); missing CI env skips the
 *   comment; a `gh`/network failure warns but never throws, so a report can't
 *   fail the build.
